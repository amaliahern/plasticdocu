<h2>Why should I create branches? </h2>
<p>
	There is another concept, equally fundamental to source control: branching. 
</p>

<p>
This is the basic concept of a branch: a line of development that exists independently of another line, yet still shares a common history. A branch always begins life as a copy of something, and moves on from there, generating its own history.</p>

<p>Branching is a very efficient process, so you can easily work with feature branches or go even further and use task branches, the model Plastic recommend.</p>

<p>
	Plastic SCM implements task-driven development efficienctly, through the well-known branch per-task pattern. You can read more in this links:
