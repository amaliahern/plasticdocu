  <h2>Your first label</h2>
  <p>
  	Let’s go to the “branch explorer” which is able to render the history of the repository graphically. In order to do that, click on “branch explorer” in the “main actions” left action bar. Something like the following will show up:
  </p>

  <p align="center"><img class="img-polaroid" id="lesson1_021" 
  	src="./bootstrap/img/lesson1/branchexplorerbeforeinitiallabel.png" ></p>

  <p align="center">Figure 1: Branch Explorer for initial label</p>

  <p>
  What is there on the graphic?? You have a branch and “two” changesets, one with a “house” on it (the current changeset loaded on your branch) and the initial one, on the left, which is the one created by Plastic by default during repo creation.
  </p>
  <p>
     The “branch” is the shape containing the two changesets.
  </p>

  <p>Right click on the changeset decorated with a “house” (the ‘current changeset’, remember) and click on the “label this changeset” action as the figure below shows:</p>

  <p align="center"><img class="img-polaroid" id="lesson1_022" 
  	src="./bootstrap/img/lesson1/clickonlabelonthebranchexplorer.png"></p>

  <p align="center">Figure 2: Click on label on the Branch Explorer</p>


  <p>Then the “create label” dialog will show up. Enter “Baseline00” for the label name and enter a comment as the following figure shows:</p>
  <p align="center"><img class="img-polaroid" id="lesson1_023" 
  	src="./bootstrap/img/lesson1/createinitiallabel.png" ></p>

  <p align="center">Figure 3: Create initial Label</p>

  <p>
  	Labels can be used to mark stable releases in your project, so you can “save” a secure status that you can recover later on.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Once the label is created, your branch explorer will look like this:
  </p>

  <p align="center"><img class="img-polaroid" id="lesson1_024" 
  	src="./bootstrap/img/lesson1/initiallabelonbranchexplorer.png"></p>

  	<strong>  And you’ve finished your initial working cycle!</strong>
