<h2>Create a workspace</h2>
<p>
	Now let’s create a workspace on the location where you uncompressed the files (remember, in my case it was C:\Users\pablo\dokan_workspace).
 </p>
<p>	In order to do it, go to the actions bar on the right and then click on “workspaces”:

<p>Then the “workspaces view” will show up, listing all the available workspaces on your machine. Click on the “create workspace” button:</p>

<p>The “create workspace” dialog will show up and then you’ve to give a name to the workspace, a path and select a repository that the workspace will use:</p>

<p>
	As you can see on the figure, I chose “dokan_workspace” as name, then I wrote the path I used to place the code downloaded from the web, then I selected the repository I’ve just created.</p>
<p>
	As you can see, there’s a new tab on the workspaces tab, with the name of the recently created workspace:
