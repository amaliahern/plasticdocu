<h2>Add your code to version control</h2>
<p>
	Now let’s add the code to the repository. In order to do that, right click on the “root” of your workspace and select “add directory tree to source control” as the following image shows:
 </p>
</p>

<p align="center">Figure 1: Add directory</p>

<p>All the tree of code will be recursively added and your “items view” will look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img id="lesson1_001" 
	src="http://192.168.1.54/~amalia/Sites/pscm/bootstrap/img/lesson1/itemsviewallprivate.png" border="0" height="99" width="369"></p>

<p>As you can see everything is in “checkedout” status, which means Plastic SCM knows about all the “added files and directories” but they are not yet checked in to the repository.</p>
<p>In order to “checkin” (send everything to the repository), just right click on the “root of the workspace” and click on “checkin” as the image below shows:</p>
<p align="center"><img id="lesson1_001"

<p>
	After clicking “checkin” a dialog will show up and will let you introduce a comment for your checkin (in my case I just typed “initial checkin”) and a list of the files to be added:
</p>

<p align="center">Figure 4: List the files to be added</p>

<p>
	Click on the “checkin” button to confirm the operation. Once the checkin completes, the “items view” will look like the following:
</p>
<p align="center"><img id="lesson1_001" 
	src="http://192.168.1.54/~amalia/Sites/pscm/bootstrap/img/lesson1/itemsviewaddedtoignoredconf.png" border="0" height="99" width="369"></p>

<p>Please note the status of all files is now “controlled” except for the “ignored” ones we configured before</p>
<p>It means you have just put your first code inside Plastic SCM control! Congratulations.</p>
