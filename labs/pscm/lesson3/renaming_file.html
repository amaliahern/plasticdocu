<h2>Renaming a file</h2>
<p>
	Renaming a file is actually equivalent to a moving it as you did before, but a rename is just a move inside the same directory.
</p>
<p>
	You can select a file and press ‘F2’ or right click to open up the context menu and select ‘rename’ as the figure below shows.

<p>
After clicking “rename” a dialog will show up and will let you introduce a new name for the selected item:</p>

<p>For example, we can write “readme_dokan.txt” as new name. Once the operation completes, the “Pending Changes View” will look like the following:</p>

<p align="center"><img id="lesson3_012" 
	src="../bootstrap/img/lesson3/pendingchangesrenamedfile_014.png"  width="80%"></p>

<p>
	Please note the status of the file is now “Moved”. Plastic knows the file has been renamed.
	Introduce a comment and checkin.
