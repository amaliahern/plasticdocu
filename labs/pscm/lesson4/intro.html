<h2>Intro to Transparent SCM</h2>
<p>
	So far we’ve followed the checkout-edit-checkin workflow: you first tell Plastic SCM you’re going to touch a file then you edit it, then you checkin. Remember checkout doesn’t mean you’re exclusively locking the file or storing any information at the server side, it just means the Plastic SCM client knows the file has been modified.
</p>
<p>
	Now we’re going to use the very extended edit-checkin workflow, which was made popular but most open source version controls (SVN, CVS, Git and many others).
</p>
<p>
	In the case of Plastic SCM, we call this way of working ‘transparent’ because, as you’ll see, Plastic is able to detect everything you’ve done in your workspace and propose it to check in.
