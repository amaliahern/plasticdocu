<p>Go to pending changes to check what we have modified so far:</p>

<p align="center"><img id="lesson4_003" 
	src="../bootstrap/img/lesson4/pendingchanges_files_003.png"  width="70%"></p>

<p align="center">Figure 3: Pending Changes View</p>

<p>
	As you can see, the pending changes view is detecting the files you’ve modified. You didn’t have to ‘checkout’ them prior to edit, and as you see, in the ‘status’ column, instead of ‘checkedout’ you can read ‘changed’.
