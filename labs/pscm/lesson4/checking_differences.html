<h2>Check the differences</h2>
<p>
	Let’s go to ”Branch Explorer” view to see the current state of the repository. Something like the following will show up:
</p>

<p align="center"><img id="lesson4_009"

<p align="center">Figure 1: Branch Explorer</p>

  Right click on the current changeset, and click on the “Diff changeset” action as the figure below:
</p>

<p align="center"><img id="lesson4_010" 
	src="../bootstrap/img/lesson4/diff_currentchangeset_010.png"  width="40%"></p>

<p align="center">Figure 2: Diff Changeset</p>

<p>
	Once the button is clicked you will see how comparing previous content with current content. The window will look like this:
</p>

<p align="center"><img id="lesson4_011" 
	src="../bootstrap/img/lesson4/diff_changeset_011.png"  width="50%"></p>

<p>
  As you can see, there are 6 items to show diff, you can show each of them clicking on the arrows.</p>

  Great, you’ve finished the fourth lab.
