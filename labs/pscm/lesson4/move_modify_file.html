<h2>Move a file and let Plastic SCM detect it for you</h2>
<p>
	What if now we decide to move one of the files we modified before? Will Plastic be able to detect it?
</p>

<p>
	We are going to move ‘dokan-net-0.6.0\DokanNet\DokanNet.cs’ to the ‘dokan-net-0.6.0\DokanNet\Properties’ directory. In order to do that we just open a Windows Explorer and move the file. And here his how “Pending changes” view will look like:

<p>
	It’s explains the move you just performed: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The status sets: “moved locally”</li>
	<li>Similarity: 99,49% because you modified the file previous to move it, so Plastic is able to detect it is still the same file because the content match at 99%.</li>
</ul>
